# SDL ASCII

A movable boat over moving sea waves drawn with ASCII characters using [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) and [SDL_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf).

## TODO

* Optimize rendering by caching glyphs and streaming them to a texture which may then be presented to the renderer instead of rendering them directly to the renderer.
